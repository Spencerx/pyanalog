# DDA and Analog synthesis codes

The particular directories hold several codes:

* PyDDA is a Python3 package for analog circuit simulation
* DDA is a Perl5 code for analog circuit simulation

There should also be examples, somewhere.

The overall plan is to open source these codes or parts of them end of 2020.
