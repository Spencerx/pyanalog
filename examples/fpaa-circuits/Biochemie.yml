#### OLD AND CERTAINLY WRONG

description: |
  This system implements the equations
    n'      = -k_{+1} n
    n'_R    =  k_{+1} n - k_u n_R - k_{+2} n_R d + k_{-2} n_{RD}
    n'_{RD} =  k_{+2} n_R d - k_{-2} n_{RD}
    d'      = -n'_{RD} + d(0)
  In this notation, x' means the time derivative of x.
  The time scale factors of all integrators are expected as k_0 = 10^3.
  All integrators have intput weights 10.
