title: RÃ¶ssler-attractor (Alpaca1)

description: |
  This system implements the equations

    x' = - 0.8y - 2.3z
    y' = 1.25x + aStar y
    z' = bStar + 15z (x-cStar)

  with aPrime=0.2, bPrime=0.005 and cPrime=0.3796
  In this notation, x' means the time derivative of x.
  
  In Alpaca1, the integrators have different weights
  and the adders most likely weight one.
  Multipliers always have weight one.
  
  In this code here, summers and integrators have weight 10.
  (Internal negating summers always have weight 1)

program:
  I1:
    type: INT2m
    input:
      a0: 0.08 # 0.8/10
      a: {I3: pos}
      b0: 0.23
      b: {I2: pos}
      ic: 0.066
      icSign: True # +1
  I2:
    type: INT2pm
    input: [0.125, I1, 0.02, I2: pos]
  I3:
    type: INT2pm
    input: [0.005, PlusOne, 0.1, S1: pos]
  M1:
    type: MUL2p
    input: [1, S2: pos, 1, I3: pos]
  S1:
    type: SUM2pm
    input: [0.1, M1: pos, 0.05, M1: pos]
  S2:
    type: SUM2pm
    input: [0.03796, MinusOne, 0.1, I1: neg]

observables:
  x: {I1: neg}
