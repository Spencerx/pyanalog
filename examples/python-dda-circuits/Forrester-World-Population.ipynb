    "# Forrester's World Dynamics Model in DDA\n",
    "\n",
    "This python notebook demonstrates how to write a popular historic model of world population in DDA. This work is based on the 2020 review of Olga Pronchev and Sergey Makhov: *J. FORRESTERâ€™S MODELOF WORLD DYNAMICS AND ITS DEVELOPMENT*. It can be found at https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7274/864d1d8a573e1507822343b7ce4b367251f8.pdf, for instance.\n",

    "\n",
    "Here, $\\dot{x}$ denotes the time derivative $\\mathrm{d}\\,x/\\mathrm{d}t$  of a time dependent function $x(t)$. This equation is written already in a primitive form where the right hand sides of the equation do not contain any derivatives at all. It is an ordinary differential equation, because there are only derivatives with respect to time. The quantities on the left hand sides, i.e. $P, K, Z, X$ and $R$, are called *evolution equantities*. \n",

    "Let's collect all symbols which occur in the above equation system.  We will do so in Python just in order to define some variables. These are (sorted by their order of occurance):"
