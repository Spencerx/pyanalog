   SUM2p:
     description: |
        A macro component made of two summers (SUM8 module) and two digital
        potentiometers (on DPT24).
        Each summer is a (negating) summer with two inputs.
        The main summer (Summer1) use weights a=10. The inverting summer
        (Summer2) uses weight a=1.
        We dont make use of the summing junctions (SJ).
        The flow chart looks like

          a0 ------+
                   |  controls
                   v

                   ^
                   |  controls
          b0 ------+

       plus:  plus  =   a0*a + b0*b
       minus: minus = -(a0*a + b0*b)

   INT2p:
     description: |
        A macro component made of an integrator (one in the INT4 module),
        two potentiometers (on DPT24) and a summer (on SUM8, used for
        negation).

        The integrator is an (implicite negative summing) intergrator
        with two inputs. For the moment, we dont make use of ModeIC and
        ModeOP. All inputs use weight a=10.

        In the moment, the ICs are realized by one potentiometer and
        a comparator. The compiler creates the binary sign which steers
        the comparator and is outputted by the Hybrid Controller (HC).

        The summer is a (negating) summer with a single input.
        The summer uses weight a=1.
        Neither in integrator nor summer, we make use of the SJ.

        The flow chart looks like

   MUL2p:
     description: |
       A simple macro element made of a single multiplier (MLT8) and two
       digital potentiometers (on DPT24).
       Note that multiplication is implemented normalized. For instance,
       if machine voltage is level=+10V (actually +-10V), the multiplication
       computes res = (a/level * b/level)*level in order to make sure
       |res|<10V.
       -> In order to decouple analog programming from the machine where
          it runs, the normalization should be implemented in the
          compilation step!
       For the moment, outputs of MUL2p are *not* provided in negated form.
     input:
       - name: a
         type: analog
       - name: b
         type: analog
       - name: a0          # for the multiplier,
         type: digital     # we could also
       - name: b0          # skip the potentiometers
         type: digital     # for the time being
     output:
       - name: o
         type: analog
     computes:
       o: o = a0*a*b0*b/voltage_level
     default_inputs:
       a0: 0
       b0: 0

   ConstantVoltage:
     description: |
       This is a pseudo-element only used for allocate a logic +1 and
       logic -1 on the XBAR.
       Usage examples are given in the partlist with the instances
       PlusOne and MinusOne. These parts are subject to be used
       also in the actual programs (for the time being), in order to
       realize constant inputs for computatational parts. We need
       +1 and -1 because the potentiometers only implement range [0,1].
       The operation x-0.5 is then realized by the pseudo-code
       SUMMER(a=x,a0=1,b=MinusOne,b0=0.5), while x+0.7 is realized by
       SUMMER(a=x,a0=1,b=PlusOne,b0=0.7).
     computes:
       value: value = x
     input:
       - name: x
         type: analog
     output:
       - name: value
         type: analog

   ComparatorAD:
     description: |
        The left part of a CMP4 comparator (analog2digital),
        i.e. a treshold based binarization.
     computes:
       res: res = a+b>0
     input:
       - name: a
         type: analog
       - name: b
         type: analog
     output:
       - name: res
         type: digital

   ComparatorDA:
     description: |
        The right part of a CMP4 comparator (digital2analog),
        i.e. a single electronic switch switching between two analog
        signals.
     computes:
       u: u = if(i, a, b)
     input:
       - name: i
         type: digital
       - name: a
         type: analog
       - name: b
         type: analog
     output:
       - name: u
         type: analog

   None:
     description: |
       This pseudo-element is only used to implement computational
       elements with unconnected inputs. For instance, the pseudo-code
       SUMMER(x)=-x is actually implemented as
       SUMMER(a=x,a0=1,b=None,b0=0)  (the value of b0 is not relevant!).
       The compiler will throw out None elements in favour of disabling
       the corresponding output line of the XBAR.
     computes: nothing
     output:
       - name: none
